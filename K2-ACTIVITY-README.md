  - 🔬 Science Lab
  - 🏀 Gymnasium
  - 🎨 Art Room
  - 🌳 The Quad
- Click each building to learn what students do there
- Visual progress tracking (checkmarks appear when visited)
- Large, touch-friendly buttons for young learners

### 3. **Algorithm Builder** (Code.org style)
- **Drag-and-drop interface**
  - Arrow toolbox (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️)
  - 5x5 grid campus sidewalk
  - Start point: 🏫 School (green)
  - End point: 🎓 Graduation (red)
- Students create algorithms by dragging arrows onto gray squares
- "Run Algorithm" button animates the path
- Instant visual feedback (success/try again)
- Teaches: sequencing, spatial reasoning, step-by-step thinking

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### Computational Thinking Skills
- ✅ **Algorithms**: Understanding step-by-step instructions
- ✅ **Sequencing**: Putting steps in the correct order
- ✅ **Spatial Reasoning**: Understanding directions (up, down, left, right)
- ✅ **Problem Solving**: Finding paths from start to finish
- ✅ **Debugging**: Trying different solutions when first attempt doesn't work

### HBCU Cultural Awareness
- Introduction to HBCU concept
- Understanding different campus buildings and their purposes
- Appreciation for academic spaces

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Teachers/Presenters

1. **Open the file**: `k2-campus-activity.html` in any web browser
2. **Full screen recommended**: Press F11 for full-screen presentation mode

### Activity Flow (30-45 minutes)

#### Part 1: Storybook (10 minutes)
- Display on screen/projector
- Read each page aloud to students
- Use "Next" button to advance pages
- Discuss: "What is an algorithm?" "What steps do you follow every day?"

#### Part 2: Campus Exploration (10-15 minutes)
- Click on each building together
- Read the descriptions aloud
- Ask: "What do you think students do in the library?"
- Watch the progress bar fill up as you visit all 6 buildings

#### Part 3: Algorithm Building (15-20 minutes)
- Explain the goal: Get from school 🏫 to graduation 🎓
- Demonstrate dragging one arrow
- Let students direct you: "Should we go right or down?"
- Click "Run Algorithm" to see if the path works
- If it doesn't work: "Let's debug! What can we change?"
- Try multiple solutions - there are many correct paths!

## 💡 Teaching Tips

### Vocabulary Words
- **Algorithm**: A list of steps to complete a task
- **Sequence**: The order of steps
- **Debug**: Fix a mistake in your algorithm

### Differentiation

**For Kindergarten:**
- Focus on the storybook and campus exploration
- Teacher guides the algorithm building
- Celebrate any attempt at creating a path

**For 1st-2nd Grade:**
- Students can attempt algorithm building independently or in pairs
- Challenge: "Can you find the shortest path?"
- Extension: "Can you create a different path?"

### Extension Activities

1. **Offline Algorithm Practice**
   - Create a floor grid with tape
   - Students give verbal directions to move a classmate

2. **Drawing Algorithms**
   - Students draw their own campus maps
   - Create arrow sequences on paper

3. **Real-Life Algorithms**
   - Discuss: "What's your algorithm for getting ready for school?"
   - Write step-by-step instructions for simple tasks

## 🖥️ Technical Requirements

- **Browser**: Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
