## Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (FREE - Recommended)

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to github.com
   - Sign up for free

2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Click "New Repository"
   - Name it: `hbcu-explorer`
   - Make it Public
   - Don't add README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create Repository"

3. **Upload files:**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop these 4 files:
     - index.html
     - styles.css
     - script.js
     - README.md
   - Click "Commit changes"

4. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Under "Source", select "main" branch

### Option 2: Google Sites

1. **Create a new Google Site:**

   - Click "Create" (blank site)
   - Name it "HBCU Campus Explorer"

2. **Add an Embed:**
   - Click "Insert" > "Embed"
   - Click "Embed Code"
   - First, you need to host the HTML somewhere (use Option 1 or 3 first)

5. **Optional:** Change the site name in settings to something like `hbcu-explorer.netlify.app`

### Option 4: Replit (FREE)

1. **Go to replit.com**
